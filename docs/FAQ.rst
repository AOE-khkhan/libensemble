How can I watch my libEnsemble routine work in real-time?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The log files ``ensemble.log`` and ``libE_stats.txt`` are updated throughout
execution. The first contains logging output, while the second summarizes each
user-calculation as it is performed.


Can I pass multiple gen_f or sim_f functions to libEnsemble?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Not at this time, but libEnsemble provides a :doc:`Job Controller<job_controller/overview>`
module that can be used within gen_f or sim_f functions to launch different types
of jobs.
