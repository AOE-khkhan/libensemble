execute: Directly run a program on the closest machine or node.

launch: Initiate or execute some program or process.

submit: Enqueue or indicate that one or more jobs or tasks needs to be launched.

jobs: Generally overarching unit of work submitted, scheduled, or queued, then launched. May contain one or more tasks.

tasks: Sub-processes or independent units of work. Many tasks make up a job.

worker: Smallest unit? (How is this different from Balsam?)
        - An additional process responsible for performing units of work, which may include submitting or executing tasks.



Questions:
- Are workers "launched"? Only in the TCP case?
